#Multi-layer	Perceptron for	classification

Perceptron is	 a	 supervised	 learning	 algorithm	 for	 classification or	 regression. 


## Installation

Install python 3.

Install linear algebra libraries numpy and scipy

```bash
pip install numpy

```
```bash
pip install matplotlib

``` 

```bash
pip install sklearn


```  
## Usage

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

```

## Contributing

MLPâ€™s can be applied to complex non-linear problems, and it also works well with large input data with a relatively faster performance. The algorithm tends to achieve the same accuracy ratio even with smaller data.
